  abstract = "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) represents a spectrum of
              conditions ranging from simple steatosis (NAFL), over
              nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with or without fibrosis, to
              cirrhosis with end-stage disease. The hepatic molecular events
              underlying the development of NAFLD and transition to NASH are
              poorly understood. The present study aimed to determine hepatic
              transcriptome dynamics in patients with NAFL or NASH compared
              with healthy normal-weight and obese individuals. RNA sequencing
              and quantitative histomorphometry of liver fat, inflammation and
              fibrosis were performed on liver biopsies obtained from healthy
              normal-weight ( n = 14) and obese ( n = 12) individuals, NAFL ( n
              = 15) and NASH ( n = 16) patients. Normal-weight and obese
              subjects showed normal liver histology and comparable gene
              expression profiles. Liver transcriptome signatures were largely
              overlapping in NAFL and NASH patients, however, clearly separated
              from healthy normal-weight and obese controls. Most marked
              pathway perturbations identified in both NAFL and NASH were
              associated with markers of lipid metabolism, immunomodulation,
              extracellular matrix remodeling, and cell cycle control.
              Interestingly, NASH patients with positive Sonic hedgehog
              hepatocyte staining showed distinct transcriptome and
              histomorphometric changes compared with NAFL. In conclusion,
              application of immunohistochemical markers of hepatocyte injury
              may serve as a more objective tool for distinguishing NASH from
              NAFL, facilitating improved resolution of hepatic molecular
              changes associated with progression of NAFLD. NEW \& NOTEWORTHY
              Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common liver
              disease in Western countries. NAFLD is associated with the
              metabolic syndrome and can progress to the more serious form,
              nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and ultimately lead to
              irreversible liver damage. Using gold standard molecular and
              histological techniques, this study demonstrates that the
              currently used diagnostic tools are problematic for
              differentiating mild NAFLD from NASH and emphasizes the marked
              need for developing improved histological markers of NAFLD
              progression.",

               from various studies. The g:Profiler toolset is widely used for
               finding biological categories enriched in gene lists,
               conversions between gene identifiers and mappings to their
               orthologs. The mission of g:Profiler is to provide a reliable
               service based on up-to-date high quality data in a convenient
               manner across many evidence types, identifier spaces and
               organisms. g:Profiler relies on Ensembl as a primary data source
               and follows their quarterly release cycle while updating the
               other data sources simultaneously. The current update provides a
               better user experience due to a modern responsive web interface,
               standardised API and libraries. The results are delivered
               through an interactive and configurable web design. Results can
               be downloaded as publication ready visualisations or delimited
               text files. In the current update we have extended the support
               to 467 species and strains, including vertebrates, plants,
               fungi, insects and parasites. By supporting user uploaded custom
               GMT files, g:Profiler is now capable of analysing data from any
               organism. All past releases are maintained for reproducibility
               and transparency. The 2019 update introduces an extensive
               technical rewrite making the services faster and more flexible.
